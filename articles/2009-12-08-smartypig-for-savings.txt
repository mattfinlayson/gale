<p></p><p><a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a> is a great tool for savings. It&#8217;s a bank account, but different. I&#8217;ve been using it for 6 months now and it&#8217;s helped my finances quite a bit and let me buy a few toys without feeling bad about it. It works pretty simply.</p><p>You create a FDIC Insured Bank Account with <a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a>.</p><p>You create a savings goal with a date, ex. $400 for a new iPhone in July 2010</p><p><a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a> determines your required monthy contribution (-2% interest you make on the account.)</p><p><a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartPig</a> will automatically withdraw that amount from your bank account every month until your goal is met.</p><p>Then you can:</p><p>If something goes wrong and you need the money:</p><p>You can also share savings goals through facebook or twitter, you can have others contribute to the account. This feature doesn&#8217;t really interest me and I don&#8217;t use it, however I could see running a charity drive through it or saving for a vacation or college with family &#8230; maybe. I still don&#8217;t like the idea of being too public with your money.</p><p>In all though, I love it. It&#8217;s like a Bank meets Layaway, and it&#8217;s way more responsible than a credit card.</p><p id="tags">Tagged with: tech, money</p>
