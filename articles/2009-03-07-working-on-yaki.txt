<h3>Date/Time Changes</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on yaki a bit. First off to fit the theme I needed to make some changes to the postinfo in the header. It&#8217;s not pretty but it works for the time being. </p>

<h3>Presentation and Logic</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not happy with the bits and pieces of presentation logic scattered around the code. I&#8217;m going to try to decouple them a bit. Not MVC.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve integrated disqus once. It was fairly theme dependent though and since clarkbw stole my theme I&#8217;ve had to switch. Oh the agony.</p>
