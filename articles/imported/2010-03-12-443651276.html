title: Cool things I had sitting open in tabs
---

<p><ul><li><a>Interview with Dave Eggers</a> on his new book and whatnot. Looks interesting and I respect the dude. Also he runs a pirate store. +10 points.</li>

<li>Some interviews from &#8216;the setup&#8217;. I find this kind of this facinating. I am curious about the number of people running macs. Same small set of software. The ones I really like are the guys that say their current setup blows. The best of those are:<br/><ul><li><a><a href="http://ben.fry.usesthis.com/">http://ben.fry.usesthis.com/</a></a></li>

<li><a><a href="http://mark.pilgrim.usesthis.com/">http://mark.pilgrim.usesthis.com/</a></a></li>

</ul></li>

<li>I think that these <a>music overlay icons</a> are fantastic</li>

<li>ManiacalRage does a really cool monthly post with <a>his new music</a> and the affore mentioned icons. I like it.</li>

<li>This looks like <a>a badass turn based game</a>. I&#8217;d like to play with someone.Â (hint hint) My username is savagegus.</li>

<li><a>I am a sucker for dynamic charts</a>. I think this is cool, you know, for graphs.</li>

<li>SimDK is a vSphere emulator. At first I thought it was dumb (see VMware&#8217;s initial response) then I saw what they&#8217;ve done with it &#8230; interesting. <a>It&#8217;s a hell of a shim.</a></li>
