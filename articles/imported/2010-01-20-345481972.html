<p>So I plan on posting a little roundup of my first week at work. But it&#8217;s safe to say it&#8217;s going pretty well and I&#8217;m enjoying it quite a bit. Also there are a ton of Thai places around the office.</p>

<p>For anyone intersted I Â found a couple flickr sets of the office. Jive is located in the old federal reserve building (there is a GIANT vault in the basement) that&#8217;s why they call it club fed.</p>
