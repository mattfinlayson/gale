<a href="http://gluonframework.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/web2py-learner/">web2py Bayesian classifier and databases « web2py</a><br/><p>Interesting approach to populating databases with sanitized data. It&#8217;s a perennial problem in development and test and I like this idea a lot more than taking a production database and scrubbing it&#8230;</p>
