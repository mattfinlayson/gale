title: Stereotyping people by their favorite author
---

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>Dan Brown: People who used to get lost in supermarkets when they were kids.<br/><br/>Dave Eggers: Guys who are in the third coolest frat of a private college.<br/><br/>Terry Goodkind: People who have never been dungeons master but still play D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Douglas Adams: People who bought the first generation Amazon Kindle.</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://laurenleto.wordpress.com/readers-by-author/">full list</a> is online. Both Eggers and Adams hit kinda close to home &#8230;</p>
