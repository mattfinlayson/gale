<p>A homebrew app for the Palm Pre <a href="http://www.precentral.net/reboot-schedule-homebrew-app-does-reboots-your-schedule">reboots your phone according to a schedule</a>.</p>

<p>This is such a perfectly encapsulated nutshell of exactly why Apple does not allow third-party background processes on the iPhone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a Pre can play music from Pandora in the background while you do something else.</p>

<p>This gets right to the very heart of the old world / new world schism.</p>
