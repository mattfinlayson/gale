title: A Synthesis
---

<blockquote>What if instead of human versus machine we played as partners? My brainchild saw the light of day in a match in 1998 in León, Spain, and we called it “Advanced Chess.” Each player had a PC at hand running the chess software of his choice during the game. The idea was to create the highest level of chess ever played, a synthesis of the best of man and machine.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/23592">Garry Kasparov: The Chess Master and the Computer</a>
