A <b>diptych</b> is any object with two flat plates attached at a hinge. In the ancient world these were usually tablets that were coated with wax on inner faces, for recording notes. The term is also used figuratively for a thematically-linked sequence of two books.</p>

<p>Using an excellent vocab word <a href="http://jasontravisphoto.com">Jason Travis</a> does portraits of people with their stuff. Good photos, interesting subjects, and fascinating piles of crap people carry around with them.</p>
