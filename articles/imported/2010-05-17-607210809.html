<blockquote><strong>What prompted the Lieberman citizenship bill?</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>Lieberman has said the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, the accused Times Square Bomber, prompted him to write this citizenship bill. Senator Lieberman has publicly decried the fact that Shahzad was read his Miranda rights (if a bit late). As an American citizen, Faisal is protected by civil rights protections, including due process.</blockquote>
