<p><span>Just last night, I remembered this incident that honestly I have never, ever talked about. I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;m going to be able to talk about it much here. But I remember in high school<span>—</span>not even high school, in junior high school; I was really, really young<span>—</span>I tried to feel a girl up <em>in front of her family</em>. I thought I could get away with it.</span></p>
