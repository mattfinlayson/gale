So, it&#8217;s in Spanish but it has a Sigor Ros kind of feel. The lyrics blend with the music and get sampled and fed back into the music as she performs. Found myself zoning out to it while working an looking up to see it&#8217;s been a couple hours.   </p>

<p>I found her through the <a href="http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/2009/05/04/juana-molina/">RadioLab podcast</a> about her music.</p>
