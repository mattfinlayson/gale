<p>Haar­lem Oost is a branch library in the Nether­lands that wanted to encour­age vis­i­tors to add tags […] to the books they read. […] To do this, the library didn’t cre­ate a com­pli­cated com­puter sys­tem or send peo­ple online. Instead, they installed more book drops and return shelves, labeled with dif­fer­ent descrip­tors like “bor­ing,” “great for kids,” “funny,” etc.</p>
