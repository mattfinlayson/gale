<a href="http://www.history.com/video.do?name=People_Speak">The People Speak</a><br/><p>Loosely based on Howard Zinn&#8217;s &#8216;A People&#8217;s History of the United States&#8217;. Excellent collection of performances of Letters, Journals, and Speeches of various Americans. Way better than UFO Hunters &#8230; history channel.</p>
