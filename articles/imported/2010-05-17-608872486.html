<p>Rationalizing the purchase of an iPad usually includes a few of these:</p>

<ul><li>I’ll carry it around most of the time.</li>

<li>I’ll be able to replace my laptop with it.</li>

<li>I’ll be able to replace my Kindle with it.</li>

<li>I’ll bring it on trips instead of my laptop.</li>

<li>I’ll respond to email with it.</li>

<li>I’ll get work done&#8230;</li>

</ul><span>After a month of heavy use, I don’t think it’s good for any of those.</span></blockquote>

<p>So that&#8217;s not the punch line. He goes on to say it&#8217;s handy as an in between device but an iPhone does better mobile, a kindle is a better book, and a laptop is a better computer. Full story for me is, I *have* the other things and I still like $500 dollars more than it.</p>
