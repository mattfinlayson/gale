title: It was never okay.
---

<blockquote>The telephone was an aberation in human development. It was a 70 year or so period where for some reason humans decided it was socially acceptable to ring a loud bell in someone else’s life and they were expected to come running, like dogs. This was the equivalent of thinking it was okay to walk into someone’s living room and start shouting. It was never okay.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://rickwebb.tumblr.com/post/556400952/the-never-call-there-are-some-people-who-love-to">Rick Webb</a> (via <a href="http://toldorknown.com/">toldorknown</a>) (via <a href="http://found.boxofjunk.ws/">inky</a>)
