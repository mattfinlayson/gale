title: Turbo Tax is a Dick
---

<p>Turbo tax tries to screw you out of the $19.95 e-file fee for state taxes. Just mail your state taxes in, only e-file federal. The only downside is TurboTax makes it difficult to do it. This is how you make it work:</p>

<ul><li>E-file federal don&#8217;t file State</li>

<li>Once complete click on Print &amp; File again</li>

<li>On the first page it will ask if you want to e-file federal, choose file by mail</li>

<li>The next screen says it can&#8217;t because you&#8217;ve submitted already</li>

<li>Continue on to print out state paperwork</li>

</ul><p>Dicks.</p>
