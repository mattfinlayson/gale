We&#8217;ve filmed the Columbia River Gorge, Mt Hood, Mt Jefferson, the Southwestern Coast, the Alvord Desert, Leslie Gulch, Blue Mountains, Crater Lake, Eagle Cap Wilderness, Deschutes River, and more. We&#8217;re proud to have touched all four corners of the state; however Oregon is the kind of place that the more you see, the more places there are to still discover. The greatest challenge with this project was being in the right place at the right time. Night timelapse sequences particularly have an unexpected number of requirements to get the bright, stunning payoff. First, the moon should be around the New Moon phase (no moon) so as not to compete with outshining the stars, so that means we get about 5 days a month window. Next, weather must be cooperative with a dependable expectancy of cloudless skies. Here in Oregon, only the Summer months have good chance of clear skies, so only 1/4 of the year offers good chance of clear skies. So that means, we have three months in the year, with a 5 day window each month to plan with fingers crossed for epic star shooting conditions. That&#8217;s only 15 days in a year. Then, you hope that something doesn&#8217;t come up in regular life to pull you away to other obligations on those few days. It is a maddening challenge getting all the factors to line up to be in the right place at the right time. But, when it does happen- it is such a satisfying feeling!
