title: The Joy of Instapaper
---

<p>Longform story: condensed. </p>

<p>One of the joys of e-readers (ala Kindle and iPad) is the format allows for different lengths of publications. In other words it&#8217;s hard to sell a 15 - 30 page book, it&#8217;s hard to print a magazine with a 30 page story, but the new medium provides a landing place for this kind of expression. </p>

<p><a href="http://Longform.org">Longform.org</a> pulls this type of story from instapaper and makes a landing page of likely material that you can push back into instapaper and consume through the web, or something like your kindle. </p>
