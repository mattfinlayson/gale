If you have seen our 2011 Showreel, you may recognize some of the animation, which was intercut there to form a visual backbone for the edit. Once the animation was complete, we sought out the musical wizardry of John Black who initially worked to find a tempo that worked with the flow of the visuals, and then gradually built up the final track in layers, adding sound design elements to synchronize with the different geometric elements.
