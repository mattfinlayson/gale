<p>The fact that he has so radically rethought author ship is actually super-interesting. It makes me think of some of these modern artists (Jeff Koons, I think; definitely Takashi Murakami) who operate entire, like, production facili­ties. They delegate a <i>lot</i> of the work of actu ally fabricating their stuff to other people.</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a way to take some of that spirit—the notion that author ship is not one-size-fits-all, that there are lots and lots of ways to organize people around the production of cre­ative work —and apply it to the objective of actually making stuff that’s great… not just making lots of stuff.</p>
