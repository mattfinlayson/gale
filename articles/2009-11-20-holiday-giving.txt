<p></p><p>It&#8217;s the holiday season yet again. Usually I participate in holiday charities though work, but this year there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much going on in the office beyond yearly charity contribution commitments. I got a catalog from Heifer International yesterday and after a little bit of background checking I&#8217;ve decided that this year I&#8217;m going to go with it.</p><p>I like the option of Bees in the catalog and the ability to donate as little as $10 for a concrete cause. You can find the <a href="http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.204586/?msource=pog">online catalog on their website</a>.</p><p>Before you make any contribution to a charity you should do a little homework, for reference &#8220;<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/2007/11/20/3-things-you-need-to-know-before-giving-to-charity/%20">Things you need to know before giving to a charity</a>&#8221;.</p><p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heifer_International">wikipedia</a>:</p><p>If you need any more encouragement, here is Alton Brown pitching for them.</p><p>
