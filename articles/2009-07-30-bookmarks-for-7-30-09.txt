This is very true for Apple (the article makes the point that Apple was able to expand to phones while keeping dominance in the mp3 player segment). I think it&#8217;s true for IBM in so far that it has more direction and focus than, say google, but in general it could use more. I think the real story here is not so much the focus, but instead it&#8217;s the movement away from commodity products and focusing on the premium segments while staying somewhat competitive in the commodity markets.</p><p><a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/writing/changed-by-web-and-weblog"><b>How the Web and the Weblog have changed writing</b></a> - Phillip Greenspun is one of my favorite website authors hands down, articles like this one are a great example why. The thesis is the web provides an avenue for publication that allows you to write in very short form or medium length (bigger than a magazine, shorter than a book) with out watering down the content. The filler example kicks ass.</p><p><i><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/360128/unsure/steve-ward-diet.jpg" /></i></p><p><a href="http://jerakeen.org/notes/2009/07/hard-to-like-android/"><b>It&#8217;s hard to like Android</b></a> - This is a run down of the standard issues with Linux vs. Windows. On the upside it&#8217;s very customizable, on the downside it needs to be customized. You can fix the problems, but do you want to?</p><p><a href="http://flyosity.com/application-design/iphone-application-design-patterns.php"><b>iPhone Application Design Patterns</b></a> - I hadn&#8217;t thought before what kinds of design patterns were being used on the iPhone, I&#8217;m curious how this translates to Android and WebOS platforms as well. I&#8217;d like to dig deeper into this space.</p>
