<p>It's 7:00 in the morning and I'm sitting in Tanners Spring park in Portland. I like this park a lot. It's just a single city block, left in it's 'natural state' it's a marsh that's you're not allowed to walk on, that would jack it up. It's on a slant and there are two little rivulets running through it. It gives a nice sound of running water which empties and a little Koi pond with a boardwalk. There are a handful of metal benches but they're covered with water this early in the morning and I don't fancy a wet ass. Luckily there is tiered turf around the edge so I have a place to sit with my Americano while I write.</p>

<p>November is NANoWriMo; National Novel Writing Month. I wanted to participate but failing sucks too, so instead I've just decided to write more.</p>

<p>I have a pretty basic problem when I write though, I have the attention span of a puppy with ADD. If I'm sitting in front of my computer I don't stay with AbiWord long enough to finish more than a few paragraphs. This tends to kill my blog posts as well as any real attempt at writing.</p>

<p>When I was looking at the NaNoWriMo site toying with the idea of participating I found a link to their flickr stream. Budding authors posting pictures of their writing areas. Laptops in coffee shops, old pc's stuck in the corner of the family room, stuff like that. What surprised me was the number of typewriters.</p>

<p>The typewriters caught my eye. Apparently in the growing hipster cities typewriter repair shops are showing up. Sometimes in the back of stationary stores (seriously they have fancy paper stores). Sometimes on their own. But the idea fascinates me. In a culture where we throw everything out, where the new hotness trumps reliability thrift and the old way of doing things people are fixing typewriters.</p>

<p>Now don't get me wrong, I'm pretty sure if they were still being made a lot people would go for the new ones. However, I can see the appeal of the mechanical writing machine. It feels like you're really doing something rather than just pushing bits. There's the feel of quality paper, and that awesome noise when you push the arm back for a new line (my vocabulary failed on the typewriter terminology&#8230;). Anyway, I can see the appeal. On the flip side, horribly expensive, finicky, and really when your done writing don't you just have to type it up again'</p>

<p>Not for me, but I can see the appeal. After flicking through a few dozen photos something else caught my eye though. The AlphaSmartPro.</p>

<p>So I'll cut to the chase, I'm writing on one now. While the keyboard could be better it's awesome and it solves the attention problem.</p>

<p>The AlphaSmartPro is this weird little word processor. I remember one of the first computers I ever saw besides my families Apple //c was my aunt and uncles word processor. It was very new and awesome at the time. Giant, very beige, and almost worthless to my 7 year old eyes. It had a built in printer if and a big plastic dust cover. (Who came up with those' The idea that a computer would be something that sits in the corner of the room and needs to be protected from dust between uses seems so odd today). Anyway it was interesting in that it hadn't occurred to me that a digital writing machine would be such a useful uni-tasker but it didn't play games and that was silly.</p>

<p>Now I've come full circle. Something that just lets me type IS useful and for $15 on Ebay it may be one of my better drunk auction bids&#8230;</p>

<p>The device in and of itself is fascinating too because it made me start thinking about legacy technology and compatibility.  After I bought it I realized I didn't have a computer with a PS/2 port or any idea what kind of software would let me get the words out of it. This could have been a device that needed a dust shield in my apartment.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn't wait to see the word processor and figure out the problem so I started googling. (Verbing weirds language.) It's mac and pc compatible, there are two ports on the side labeled 'PC' with a ps/2 port and 'Mac/IIGS' with an ADP port. Even though I have a macbook I figured APD was a no go and sure enough an ADP to USB adapter is like $50 bucks. Ps/2 was a bit of a boondoggle as well, if you don't have a usb compatible keyboard (and judging by its age I didn't) it won't work. What you need is an active ps/2 to usb adapter. That will actually do a conversion and send the proper key codes. Add a male to male 3' ps/2 cable and I had a $12 solution. What about the software though'</p>

<p>This is where the simplicity of the technology shined though. It's really just a keyboard with a 4 line 40 character LCD with a massive buffer. Hook it up and hit the 'send' key in the corner and it type into the computer. Just fire up AbiWord or office or whatever any you have a phantom typist replaying your keystrokes into your editor in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>So there we go a little rambly but that sums up an hour of my Saturday morning thinking about how awesome old technology can be and getting me writing without any more distraction that a genius playlist built off of M. Ward for a cloudy weekend morning in the park.</p>
